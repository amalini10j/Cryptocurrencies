Respository to perform unsupervised machine learning model to decide which cryptocurrency is the best to invest in


## Overview of Cryptocurrency Analysis

A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they need a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data for the analysis is not ideal, so it had to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no predefined output, using unsupervised learning was the best way forward. To group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm was used. 

## Results
The cryptocurrency investment would be based on analyazing the various clusters or groups into which the various cryptocurrencies was put by the unsupervised machine learning model.
